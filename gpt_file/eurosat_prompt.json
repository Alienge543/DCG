{
  "Annual Crop Land": [
    "A centered satellite image of annual crop land typically shows vast green fields with occasional patches of brown or yellow, depending on the crop growth stage.",
    "The surface appears highly regular, with parallel rows or grid-like textures due to mechanized planting patterns.",
    "The land is divided into clearly demarcated rectangular or irregular-shaped plots, often separated by roads or hedgerows.",
    "Small farmhouses, irrigation systems, or machinery paths can be spotted near the edges of cultivated zones.",
    "These crop fields are usually surrounded by sparse tree lines, dirt roads, or occasionally adjacent to natural vegetation or pasture land."
  ],
  "Forest": [
    "A centered satellite image of a forest typically appears as a deep green or dark green area, sometimes mixed with lighter shades depending on tree species and density.",
    "The surface has a dense, uneven texture with a natural, irregular pattern and minimal visible bare earth.",
    "Forested regions often form large contiguous blocks or irregular patches, with natural, curving edges unlike the geometric shapes of farmlands.",
    "In hilly or mountainous areas, forests show visible shadow gradients and canopy cover following terrain contours.",
    "Forests are often bordered by rivers, grasslands, or agricultural land, creating high-contrast boundaries in the satellite imagery."
  ],
  "Herbaceous Vegetation Land": [
    "A centered satellite image of herbaceous vegetation land typically appears as a light green or yellowish-green area with a fine, consistent texture.",
    "The vegetation cover is low and sparse, creating a relatively smooth visual surface compared to forests or croplands.",
    "The land patches are usually irregular in shape and may include open grassy areas, shrubs, or seasonal ground cover.",
    "This land type often appears on flat terrain or gently sloping areas, without sharp elevation changes visible from above.",
    "Herbaceous vegetation land is usually found adjacent to forest edges, pasture areas, or barren land, creating soft boundaries in satellite imagery."
  ],
  "Highway or Road": [
    "A centered satellite image of a highway or road typically shows long, narrow linear features that appear in dark gray, black, or white tones depending on the surface material.",
    "Highways and roads exhibit strong geometric continuity, often running straight or gently curving across the landscape with clear directionality.",
    "These linear structures contrast sharply with natural surroundings such as green vegetation or brown soil, making them visually distinctive.",
    "Road networks can form grids, intersections, or branching paths and are often accompanied by vehicles, lane markings, or roadside barriers.",
    "Highways are usually bordered by bare ground, grass strips, or urban infrastructure, creating high-contrast boundaries easily detected from space."
  ],
  "Industrial Buildings": [
    "A centered satellite image of industrial buildings typically shows large rectangular or square-shaped structures with flat roofs, often gray, white, or metallic in color.",
    "These buildings are usually arranged in clusters with visible access roads, parking lots, and loading zones surrounding them.",
    "The layout of industrial areas is often highly organized, forming grids or blocks separated by wide paved streets or fences.",
    "Industrial rooftops often feature ventilation units, skylights, or solar panels, which may appear as small repeating patterns.",
    "Industrial zones are typically located near transportation infrastructure such as highways or railways, and are visually distinct from residential or natural areas."
  ],
  "Pasture Land": [
    "A centered satellite image of pasture land typically shows large open green fields with relatively uniform vegetation and soft texture.",
    "The land may be divided into irregularly shaped plots by fences, dirt paths, or hedgerows, which can appear as thin lines from above.",
    "Patches of bare soil or trampled earth may be visible in areas of frequent animal movement, especially near water sources or shelters.",
    "In some regions, scattered livestock such as cows or sheep may appear as small dark spots dotting the green surface.",
    "Pasture land is often located adjacent to farmland, forest, or rural infrastructure, with low-contrast natural boundaries."
  ],
  "Permanent Crop Land": [
    "A centered satellite image of permanent crop land typically shows evenly spaced vegetation rows forming regular patterns, often in shades of green or brown.",
    "These areas often appear as neatly organized grids or concentric circles, depending on the irrigation method used (e.g., center pivot systems).",
    "The land may contain orchards, vineyards, or plantations, with visible gaps between planting lines indicating consistent planting structure.",
    "Color variations across the fields may indicate different crop species, seasonal stages, or maintenance zones.",
    "Permanent crop lands are usually adjacent to farm roads, irrigation channels, or small service buildings, offering structured visual context."
  ],
  "Residential Buildings": [
    "A centered satellite image of residential buildings typically shows clusters of small rectangular or square-shaped rooftops arranged in a grid or semi-grid pattern.",
    "The rooftops are usually light-colored (white, gray, red, or brown), and separated by narrow roads, driveways, or small yards.",
    "Residential areas often contain green patches such as gardens, trees, or parks interspersed between the houses.",
    "The layout may include a mix of single-family homes, low-rise apartments, and community buildings, resulting in moderate building density.",
    "These zones are generally located near roads and exhibit a structured but varied pattern compared to more uniform industrial or agricultural areas."
  ],
  "River": [
    "A centered satellite image of a river typically shows a long, winding blue or green line cutting through the landscape, often with curving or meandering paths.",
    "The riverbanks are usually bordered by vegetation, forming soft green edges that contrast with the water body.",
    "Tributaries or branching streams may be visible, especially near deltas or junctions, forming complex, tree-like patterns.",
    "Wider rivers appear as smooth, dark surfaces, while narrow sections may show turbulent textures or reflections depending on sun angle.",
    "Rivers often flow through or near forest, farmland, or urban areas, creating a natural linear feature that connects diverse land types."
  ],
  "Sea or Lake": [
    "A centered satellite image of a sea or lake typically shows a large, continuous body of water in blue, dark green, or turquoise tones depending on depth and clarity.",
    "The water body is often irregularly shaped with curved or jagged shorelines that may include beaches, peninsulas, or inlets.",
    "The surface appears smooth and homogeneous, though lighter patches may indicate shallow regions or wave activity near the edges.",
    "Small islands, boats, or docks may appear as bright or dark specks within or around the water area, adding high-contrast details.",
    "Sea and lake environments are usually bordered by natural vegetation, rocky coastlines, or human infrastructure like harbors or buildings."
